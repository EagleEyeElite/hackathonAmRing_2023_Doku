# Meet GreenBot

GreenBot serves as the most user-friendly interface for sustainability databases. Our chatbot solution empowers you to understand the environmental footprint of your purchases by providing detailed metrics such as water consumption, CO2 emissions, and transportation impact. This knowledge equips you to make more informed and sustainable decisions daily.

# How It Works

Engaging with GreenBot is a breeze. Just send a message containing the name of the product you're interested in. Our AI model will then access our database to gather data on the product's environmental metrics. Using these metrics, the model generates a comprehensive response, enabling you to make quicker and more informed decisions about your purchases.

# Benefits

GreenBot helps you cultivate a keen intuition for making environmentally conscious choices. It gives you insight into which products are environmentally friendly or not, based on metrics like water consumption, CO2 emissions, transportation impact, and other sustainability measures. Furthermore, we also consider human impact metrics, such as child labor, and provide the ability to compare your product with others in the same category.

# Technical Details

The user's message is interpreted by our AI model, which then queries our connected databases. It generates a user-friendly response based on the information gathered from these databases and delivers it directly to you. In addition to text, GreenBot will process image or speech inputs using Google Tesseract OCR for image-to-text conversion and Kaldi for speech-to-text conversion.

# Further Implementations

We aim to enhance the user experience by implementing speech and image-to-text capabilities for easier input. We're also focusing on improving our database by leveraging existing external databases, crowdsourcing efforts (like "open food database" and "open street map"), and expecting more databases from future regulations. We're working towards making our data model more reliable for accurate facts and developing a recommendation model that will suggest eco-friendly products.
